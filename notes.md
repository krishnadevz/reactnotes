**Notes**


* A few things that you need to note when you create components in React
is that when you define your own components and add them to React,
you should always start the name of the component with a capital letter.
This way the React compiler recognizes that that should be
mapped into a corresponding React.createElement. In react And tags that usually start with a small letter, or
lower case letter, is typically integrated as a DOM tag.
